 democratic_unity_subtype_desc:0 "All anthros are born and shall remain free and equal in rights. Of course, the different species may have disputes with each other, but we sincerely believe that in the end, all the people, no matter their specie, their political orientation, ultimately deserve to be trusted.\n\nAlthough it is tempting to want to protect people from themselves, people have the right to dignity, they have the right to choose their own destiny together, in the democratic process. Life has meaning only if it is lived freely, without this the individual is nothing more than a tool expandable in the hands of others. \n\n§CTyrants, we have no need for your self-proclaimed protection, for we all protect each other together united by the sacred bonds of brotherhood!§!"
 autoritarian_unity_subtype_desc:0 "Despite all their ideals and promises, democracies are doomed to fail, for greed and selfishness resides in all things, and will inevitably bring their demises. The only way to fight against these forces is to have a government strong enough to supress dissent, stample on corruption and makes sure the interests of the nation comes before the interests of the few.\n\nThe people can hate us as much as they want, we are the shield that protect them from their worst enemy; themselves. Under our rule, herbivores and carnivores are in the same boat, both must comply with our laws and both will be offered what we all want: a long and happy life. There is no doubt that if they were left from their own devices, they would end up killing each others.\n\n§gIt is the duty of the shepherd to take care of its flock!§!"
 carnivore_supremacy_subtype_desc:0 "Might makes right! This is the natural order of things, as established by natural selection. And yet we carnivores have been denied our rightful place in this world, in the name of nonsense such as culture, morality, or philosophy.\n\nEnough of this! All these vulgar degenerate concepts are fabrications created by those who fear our true strength to enslave us. From now on, we will no longer demean ourselves in order to suit weak species. No! From now on, we will reclaim our rightful place in animal rule: at the top. We will feast on the preys because it is their only purpose in this world. We will crush and enslave the weaks because we can, and we want it!\n\n§RThis is the dawn of a new age, the Age of the Carnivores!§!"
 herbivore_contingency_subtype_desc:0 "There are people who believe that herbivores and carnivores can live together in peace, wolves and lambs, owl and mouses, lion and antelope. These people are deluded.\n\nNo matter their clothes, their manners, their promises, carnivores remain in their hearts predators, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Murder is their nature, carnage is their doing. Those who deny so are not only a threat to themselves, but to us all. And we are tired of being just cattle to them, tired of seeing our children's throats cut by these wild beasts, tired of seeing blood being shed while idiots sing the fable of inter-species friendship.\n\n§RWe're going to make sure once and for all that never again a predator kills one of our own!§!"
